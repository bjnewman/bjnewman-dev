<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>Things I've built to learn, experiment, and demonstrate what I can do. More coming soon as I finally start building stuff outside of work.</p>

<h2>This Website</h2>
<p><em>Personal site built with Eleventy + React</em></p>

<p>Meta, right? Built this site to showcase my work and prove I can still build things from scratch after years of working on legacy enterprise systems.</p>

<p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Haven't built much frontend from scratch lately at work. Wanted to use modern tools and demonstrate I can set up a full development environment and architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Eleventy for static site generation</li>
  <li>React + Vite for interactive components</li>
  <li>Bun for package management</li>
  <li>Nunjucks templating</li>
  <li>Custom CSS (no frameworks — keeping it simple)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Architecture Decision:</strong> Eleventy-first approach where most pages are static HTML, with React components available for interactive features when needed. Best of both worlds — fast static pages with the option to add interactivity where it makes sense.</p>

<h2>More Projects Coming Soon</h2>

<p>Currently working on a few side projects to demonstrate skills I don't get to use at my day job:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building something with modern React patterns and hooks</li>
  <li>Experimenting with [technology you want to learn]</li>
  <li>Contributing to open source (looking for the right project)</li>
</ul>
