<h1>Hey, I'm BJ Newman</h1>

<p>I'm a software developer who builds scalable web applications and solves complex business problems. Currently looking for my next opportunity to make an impact.</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>

<p>I specialize in full-stack development with React and Java, building systems that handle millions of daily transactions. My sweet spot is translating messy business requirements into clean, maintainable solutions that actually work in production.</p>

<p>Former lawyer turned developer — which means I'm annoyingly good at documentation and asking "but what if..." questions.</p>

<h2>Recent Work</h2>

<p>For the past seven years at Availity, I've been building healthcare technology that connects providers and insurance companies. Think: parsing gnarly ANSI X12 transaction formats (the 275, 276, 277 gang), architecting configuration-based solutions to replace one-off custom builds, and making sure millions of healthcare transactions flow reliably every day.</p>

<p>Promoted to Tech Lead after repeatedly shipping solutions that scaled across dozens of payers and thousands of providers.</p>

<h2>Why I'm Here</h2>

<p>After nearly seven years of meaningful work in healthcare tech, I've hit the ceiling on internal growth opportunities. Time to build something new and find a team that's as excited about solving hard problems as I am.</p>
