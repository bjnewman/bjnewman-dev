  <h2>What I Do</h2>

  <p>I lead a team building healthcare systems that serve 100k+ daily users. What I'm good at: taking messy business requirements and turning them into clean code that works in production.</p>

  <h2>Work</h2>

  <p>I'm a tech lead at Availity, building the infrastructure that helps healthcare providers and insurance companies exchange information. Configuration-driven systems, millions of daily transactions, the kind of architecture that has to work because people's claims depend on it.</p>
