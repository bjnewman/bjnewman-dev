  <h2>What I Do</h2>

  <p>I specialize in full-stack development with React and Java, building systems that handle millions of daily transactions. My sweet spot is translating messy business requirements into clean, maintainable solutions that actually work in production.</p>

  <p>Former lawyer turned developer — which means I'm annoyingly good at documentation and asking hypothetical questions.</p>

  <h2>Work</h2>

  <p>I'm a tech lead at Availity, building healthcare technology that connects providers and insurance companies. My work involves parsing ANSI X12 transaction formats (claim submissions - 837 and 277CA, claim status 276 and 277s, attachments 275 and 277RFAIs), architecting configuration-based solutions that scale across dozens of payers and thousands of providers, and making sure millions of healthcare transactions flow reliably every day.</p>

  <p>I lead a team building applications that serve 100k+ daily users and contribute over 10% of Availity's traffic. The work involves technical leadership, architecture decisions, and solving complex problems at scale.</p>

  <h2>Side Projects</h2>

  <p>Outside of work, I'm building this page and exploring new technologies and techniques to get a change from the enterprise systems I work with daily.</p>
