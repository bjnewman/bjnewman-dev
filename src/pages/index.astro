  <h2>What I Do</h2>

  <p>I lead a team building healthcare systems that serve 100k+ daily users. My sweet spot is translating messy business requirements into clean, maintainable solutions that actually work in production.</p>

  <p>The lawyer background wasn't a detour — my arguments about code come with citations to the WHATWG HTML spec. I read RFC 2119 for fun, track TC39 proposals like some people track fantasy football, and have opinions about which features deserve Stage 3.</p>

  <h2>Work</h2>

  <p>I'm a tech lead at Availity, building healthcare technology that connects providers and insurance companies. My work involves parsing ANSI X12 transaction formats (claim submissions - 837 and 277CA, claim status 276 and 277s, attachments 275 and 277RFAIs), architecting configuration-based solutions that scale across dozens of payers and thousands of providers, and making sure millions of healthcare transactions flow reliably every day.</p>

  <p>I lead a team building applications that serve 100k+ daily users and contribute over 10% of Availity's traffic. The work involves technical leadership, architecture decisions, and solving complex problems at scale.</p>

  <h2>Side Projects</h2>

  <p>Outside of work, I'm building this page and exploring new technologies and techniques to get a change from the enterprise systems I work with daily.</p>
