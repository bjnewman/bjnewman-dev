  <h1>Projects</h1>

  <p>My main project is the one that pays my bills — building healthcare systems at scale. I don't have a graveyard of half-finished todo apps and I'm at peace with that.</p>

  <h2>The Work</h2>

  <p>Most of what I build is proprietary, but the scale is real: millions of daily transactions, 100k+ users, systems that healthcare providers actually depend on. I can't show you the code, but I'm happy to talk architecture, tradeoffs, and how it feels to be L3 pager support 24/7/365.</p>

  <p>Check out my <a href="/resume/">resume</a> for the details, or <a href="/about#lets-connect">reach out</a> if you want to dig into specifics.</p>

  <h2>This Website</h2>

  <p><em>Personal site built with Astro + React</em></p>

  <p>Built this site to have a home on the internet and prove I can still spin something up from scratch after years of enterprise work.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Astro for static site generation</li>
