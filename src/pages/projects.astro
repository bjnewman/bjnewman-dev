  <h1>Projects</h1>

  <p>My main project is the one that pays my bills — building healthcare systems at scale. I don't have a graveyard of half-finished todo apps to show you, and I'm at peace with that.</p>

  <p>This site is the current side project. More to come if inspiration strikes and my team stops shipping features.</p>

  <h2>This Website</h2>
  <p><em>Personal site built with Astro + React</em></p>

  <p>Meta, right? Built this site to showcase my work and prove I can still build things from scratch after years of working on legacy enterprise systems.</p>

  <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Haven't built much frontend from scratch lately at work. Wanted to use modern tools and demonstrate I can set up a full development environment and architecture.</p>

  <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Astro for static site generation</li>
    <li>React for interactive components</li>
    <li>Bun for package management</li>
    <li>TypeScript for type safety</li>
    <li>Custom CSS (no frameworks — keeping it simple)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Architecture Decision:</strong> Astro-first approach with Islands architecture where most pages are static HTML, with React components available for interactive features when needed.</p>
