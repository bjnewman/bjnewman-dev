<Base title="About">
  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <h2>The Short Version</h2>

  <p>I'm a full-stack developer specializing in React and Java. Former lawyer who discovered that writing code is way more satisfying than writing briefs. Based in Happy Valley, OR, currently working as a Tech Lead at Availity building healthcare technology.</p>

  <h2>The Career Path</h2>

  <p>Started as a lawyer, realized I enjoyed solving logical puzzles more than arguing about them. Made the jump to software development and joined the legions of satisfied ex-lawyers.</p>

  <p>Joined Availity as a developer and spent seven years building the infrastructure that helps healthcare providers and insurance companies talk to each other. Turns out American healthcare runs on some wild data formats (looking at you, ANSI X12), and someone has to make sense of them. Worked across multiple teams handling different transaction types — 837 and 277CAs for claim submissions, 276/277 for claim status, 275 and 277RFAIs for attachments.</p>

  <p>Got promoted multiple times as I took on bigger challenges — from individual contributor to Tech Lead. Built configuration-driven systems that replaced dozens of one-off custom solutions, architected workflows that handle millions of transactions daily, and led teams through AWS cloud migrations.</p>

  <h2>What Gets Me Excited</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Complex problems</strong> — The kind where you have to diagram it out on a whiteboard three times before it clicks</li>
    <li><strong>Scalable architecture</strong> — Building something once that works for 1 user and 1,000,000 users</li>
    <li><strong>User experience</strong> — If the people using the app are miserable, you've failed</li>
    <li><strong>Business impact</strong> — Cool tech is fun, but does it actually solve the problem?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Law</h2>

  <p>I went to law school and I practiced for a little bit. It turns out legal reasoning and software architecture have a lot in common — breaking down complex problems, thinking through edge cases, and building systems that hold up under scrutiny.</p>

  <p>The main difference? Code either works or it doesn't. Much less ambiguity. Much more satisfying.</p>

  <h2>Beyond Code</h2>

  <p>When I'm not debugging production issues or refactoring CI and javascript build pipelines, I'm spending time with my dog Carlos and family in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
