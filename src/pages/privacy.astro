  <h1>Privacy</h1>

  <p>I value privacy and will never collect or sell your data. Here's exactly what happens when you visit this site:</p>

  <h2>What This Site Doesn't Do</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>No cookies</li>
    <li>No analytics or tracking</li>
    <li>No third-party scripts that phone home</li>
    <li>No ads</li>
    <li>No data sold to anyone</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What This Site Does</h2>

  <h3>Theme Preference</h3>

  <p>If you change the color theme, your preference is saved in your browser's localStorage. This stays on your device and is never sent anywhere. You can clear it anytime in your browser settings.</p>

  <h3>Contact Form</h3>

  <p>If you use the contact form, your name, email, and message are sent to a private Google Sheet that only I can access. I use this information solely to respond to you. You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting me.</p>

  <h3>Hosting</h3>

  <p>This site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Like any web server, it logs IP addresses and request data in standard server logs. I don't access these logs for tracking purposes. See <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare's privacy policy</a> for details.</p>

  <h2>Protect Yourself</h2>

  <p>Most of the internet isn't this respectful of your privacy. I recommend installing browser extensions that block trackers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uBlock Origin</a> — blocks ads and trackers</li>
    <li><a href="https://privacybadger.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Badger</a> — learns to block invisible trackers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I donate to the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACLU</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EFF</a>, organizations that fight for civil liberties and digital rights. Consider supporting them too.</p>

  <h2>Questions?</h2>

  <p>If you have any questions about this policy, <a href="/about/">get in touch</a>.</p>
